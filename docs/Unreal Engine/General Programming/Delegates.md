# Delegates

## Why should you use Delegates?
Delegates are an amazing way of doing callbacks because of the following

- Prevents you from the hassle of needing to store and maintain references
- In many cases it prevents you from doing casting on objects
- Efficient way to pass parameter to a function, it encapsulates the logic and makes it neat
- You have the option to bind and unbind callbacks giving more flexibility
- Prevents the need to pass parameters through multiple functions, and instead can directly broadcast
to the required function

and more, it's a neat little feature that saves a lot of time and makes the program more neat and robust

## Where can I learn about them easily?

Well, I found this website, it's the best documentation one could ever come across regarding delegates
in Unreal Engine. It even has a tool that helps you find the appropriate delegate `MACRO` that you
need for your situation.
