# Introduction

## Steam SDK

Steam SDK allows you to use many features that doesn't come with Unreal Engine's Steam Subsystem. Unreal Engine's subsystem is a common subsystem for different online services, so it doesn't have all the Steam specific features. It only provides features that are common to the different online services like `EOS(Epic Online Services)`, `PlayFab`, `Steam`, `Xbox Live`, `PlayStation(PSN)` etc.

Using Steam SDK you can leverage Steam specific features such as
- Game Notification
- Stats and Achievement
- Steam Cloud
- Steam DRM
- Steam Inventory Service
- Steam Leaderboards
- Valve Anti-Cheat

and many other features, to get a overview of them all check out this page from Steam SDK's documentation : [Steamworks Features](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features)
