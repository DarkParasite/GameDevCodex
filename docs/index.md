# ***Game Dev Codex***

**Live site :green_circle:** : [GameDevCodex](https://darkparasite.github.io/GameDevCodex/)

## CODEX :material-script-text:
This site consists of notes and tips related to Game Development and mainly 
about Unreal Engine. Since Unreal Engine's documentation is missing a lot of 
important documentation, I have compiled various `code`, `implementation logic`, `integration
procedures` and other `tips` which I found across different **forums**, **books** 
and **blogs**.  


Why? : I spend hours searching and reading through stuff, so you don't have to, Cheers!

## Who Am I? :fontawesome-solid-dice-d20:

I'm a self-taught Game Programmer, and I primarily work with `Unreal Engine`. I get 
high by building, maintaining and testing complex game projects. I love 
learning new things and equipping myself better every day. 

I love working with `C++` more than anything and really interested to do low level
programming

Currently, I'm looking for a job in Game Industry where I can work with really
smart people and learn to master writing good software from them.
